A Crime Record Management System (CRMS) is a software application designed to systematically store, retrieve, analyze, and manage data related to criminal cases. Here are the typical requirements for developing such a system, categorized into functional and non-functional requirements:

‚úÖ Functional Requirements
These define what the system should do.

1. User Management
User authentication (login/logout)

Role-based access control (e.g., admin, officer, analyst)

Add/Edit/Delete user profiles

2. Crime Data Management
Add new crime records (including case details, location, time, type, description)

Edit and update existing records

Delete/archive old or resolved cases

3. Criminal Profile Management
Register criminals with photo, fingerprint, biometrics, known aliases

Maintain previous criminal records and status (active, incarcerated, released)

4. Victim & Witness Management
Record personal details of victims and witnesses

Link them with associated cases

5. Case Tracking and Status
Assign cases to specific officers or departments

Track case progress and updates

Change status: Open, Under Investigation, Closed, Suspended

6. Search and Filter Functionality
Search crimes by type, date, area, status, involved persons

Advanced filters (e.g., weapon used, modus operandi)

7. Report Generation
Generate printable reports: daily logs, crime summaries, trends

Export to PDF/Excel

8. Crime Analytics (Optional for advanced systems)
Crime pattern analysis

Heat map generation based on geographic data

Predictive modeling using historical data

9. Evidence Management
Attach images, videos, audio, or scanned documents

Track chain-of-custody for each piece of evidence

10. Notification System
Alerts for case updates or new assignments

Email/SMS integration (optional)

‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements
These define how the system should behave.

1. Performance
Fast response time for searches and data entry

Scalable to handle large datasets

2. Security
Data encryption (at rest and in transit)

Audit trails for all user actions

Secure authentication protocols

3. Usability
Intuitive and user-friendly UI for police/non-technical staff

Mobile-responsive or app-based access (optional)

4. Reliability
Automatic backup system

Minimal downtime with disaster recovery options

5. Maintainability
Modular architecture for easy updates and maintenance

Well-documented code and database schema

6. Interoperability
Option to integrate with national ID systems, CCTV feeds, or other police databases

üìÅ Example Data Fields
Case ID, Crime Type, Date/Time, Location (lat/long), Description

Officer Assigned, Status, Weapon Used
